# Basic Weapon System In Unity

This tutorial shows how to create an easily expandable weapon system in Unity.

## 1. Set up scene

Under your player create a new game object and call it `Gun`, this will act as the object that we use to contain all of the logic of the weapon script.

Now create a new layer and call it `Enemy`, this will act as the enemy laer so the weapon can identify what the targets are.
